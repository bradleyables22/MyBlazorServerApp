                 <h3>Blue Ridge Group has been able to meet the fast paced Covid-19 situation utilizing proprietary rapid application development built in the .NET framework.

                <p>One of the hardest lessons for me to truly understand was delegation. Releasing control and empowering employees with my trust to handle situations did not come naturally to me. The feeling of worry has been replaced with employee satisfaction in accomplishing tough tasks on time.</p>

                <p>This is a mindset taken from my time as a team leader in the U.S Army. Take the time to understand your people by working the frontlines. A better understanding of what they experience leads to faster initiative implementation.</p>
